# Interview Notes — AI Demand & Adoption Intelligence

## 30-second pitch
I built a market-intelligence dashboard suite that quantifies AI tool demand and adoption across Image, Video, and Coding categories using real public datasets (Trends + Developer Survey + Industry report). The dashboards answer: what’s growing, what’s stable, and which tools are best-fit for each job.

## What problem this solves
Teams often choose AI tools based on hype. This project creates a repeatable scoring framework using measurable signals.

## Datasets used (fill in as we build)
- Google Trends (US)
- Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025
- McKinsey State of AI 2025
- (Optional) Product Hunt + GitHub

## Key metrics (we will implement)
- Demand Score + 90-day growth + momentum
- Volatility (hype vs stable)
- Coding adoption (survey-based)
- Top industries + functions using AI agents

## How to explain the dashboard
(We will add a clean storyline once dashboards are built.)
